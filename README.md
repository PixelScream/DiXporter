DiXporter
=========

A simple exporter for 3Ds Max forcused on fast iteration times between max and engine

Why
=========

Was getting sick of how repetative it is exporting iterative saves to engine
Also Unity only works Y up and Max only works Z up so we've tried to counteract that at the point of export

Known issues!
=========

I'm vary aware the first time you launch it of a new season and pull up the prefrences window it bugs out, 
this project's very adhoc but this is next on the list

When it gives you the error window, close both windows and run the script again! 
Should be fine after that till you restart Max
